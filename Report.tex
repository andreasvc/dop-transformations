\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we investigate Data-Oriented Transformation,
based on the existing formalisms of Data-Oriented Parsing, synchronous
grammar, and the Goodman Reduction. The goal is to define and evaluate a general
formalism for learning arbitrary transformations composed of movement and insertions
based on annotated exemplars.  Parsing a sentence should result in a pair of trees
corresponding to the original and a transformed sentence. 
This stochastic approach contrasts with purely rule-based formalisms such as
transformational grammar, in which abstract representations are manipulated
with {\em a priori} specified operations. %The acquisition [... forgot my train of thought here; something about it being a contentious issue, structure dependency etc.]
The test case will be declarative versus interrogative sentences.

\section{Introduction}

Data Oriented Parsing (DOP) has proven to be a successful framework for the
parsing of natural language and several other applications in computational
linguistics. In this paper, we will explore options of using a DOP-based method
to be able to perform frequently occurring transformations in natural language.
The main example used of such transformations will be that between declarative
and interrogative sentences in English, but the developed framework should be
generalizable to other transformations, such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item Transformations between affirmative and negative sentences.
\item The transformation between the `main clause' and `auxiliary clause'
	sentence order in Dutch.
\item Active versus passive sentences, focus, wh-fronting, etc.
%\item Similar transformations in other languages.
\end{itemize}

For this project, we make use of a number of existing frameworks that may prove
useful to us. In particular, these include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Synchronous grammars, as developed by \citet{chiang2006introduction}.
\item Data Oriented Translation framework by \citet{poutsma2000msc, poutsma2000coling}.
\item The Goodman-reduction, as developed by \citet{goodman2003efficient}.
\end{itemize}

In section \ref{sec:theor}, these underlying frameworks (as well as their
relevance to our project) will be explained in a somewhat more detailed
fashioned; then in section \ref{sec:approach}, our own approach will be
described more comprehensively; in section \ref{sec:implem}, further details
regarding our implementation will be given, and in section \ref{sec:eval}, the
obtained results will be presented.

\section{Theoretical framework}
\label{sec:theor}

We will use a data-oriented approach. This is opposed to the abstract, rule-based
formalisms such as transformational grammar, which assume abstract structures in
addition to surface structures. See figure \ref{synchdop} for a diagrammatic overview
the relation of our project to traditional, generative approach.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Overview of transformations: the orthodox approach (transformational grammar),
	contrasted with our data-oriented approach}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Synchronous grammars}
\label{subsec:synch}

In \citet{chiang2006introduction}, the concept of a synchronous grammar is
introduced, as a tool to easily extend the notion of a (P)CFG into the domains
of translation and transformation. The main idea, here, is that instead of
single CFG-rules with a left and right hand side, every rule now has a pair of
right-hand sides -- one corresponding to the source language, and the other
corresponding to the target language. Moreover, there has to be a bijective
function between the nonterminal symbols on both right-hand sides.

Parsing and translating using synchronous grammars is just as easy as it is for
regular PCFGs: to translate, we simply parse using the right-hand sides
corresponding to the source language. By reading off the right-hand sides
corresponding to the target language, of the rules used in the derivation, the
translation is immediately obtained.

Some problems with synchronous grammars are also mentioned in
\citet{chiang2006introduction}. One of these problems is that, in reality, tree
structures often do not coincide between the original language and the
translated language. For example:

\ex.
\label{johnenfr}

%failed attempt to get <=> aligned in the middle vertically. oh well.
\begin{tabular}{ r m{3em} l }
\begin{parsetree}
( .S.
	( .NP. `John' )
	( .VP.
		( .V. `misses' )
		( .NP. `Mary' )
	)
)
\end{parsetree}
& $\iff$ &
\begin{parsetree}
( .S.
	( .NP. `Mary' )
	( .VP.
		( .V. `manque' )
		( .PP.
			( .P. `Ã ' )
			( .NP. `John' )
		)
	)
)
\end{parsetree}
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1em}

A common analysis of \ref{johnenfr} is problematic under the original
framework of synchronous grammars, because of the mismatch in the tree
structures.

Similarly, when looking at transformations between declarative and
interrogative sentences, and basing ourselves on standard analyses of the
Stanford parser (which are based on the annotation of the Penn
treebank), we encounter the following pairs of trees:

\ex. \label{marylike}

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\begin{parsetree}
( .S.
    (.NP. (.NNP. `Mary'))
    (.VP. (.VBZ. `likes')
      (.NP. (.NNS. `cars')))
)
\end{parsetree}
& $\iff$ &
\begin{parsetree}
  (.SQ. (.VBD. `does')
    (.NP. (.NNP. `Mary'))
    (.VP. (.VB. `like')
      (.NP. (.NNS. `cars')))
    )
\end{parsetree}
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1em}

Again, we here are faced with a pair of sentences, where the tree structures
are rather different from each other.

As a solution to the problem of a mismatch, the notion of flattening is named.
In this case, several CFG-rules are collapsed into a single rule, so that the
mismatch between the trees is resolved.

\subsection{DOP for translations}

In \citet{poutsma2000msc, poutsma2000coling}, synchronous grammars are extended
from plain PCFGs to the DOP framework: instead of looking at rules with two
right-hand sides and a corresponding set of non-terminals, we now consider
pairs subtrees with identical top nodes, and corresponding non-terminal leaf
nodes.

These linked subtrees are then combined into a bag of linked subtree pairs,
which can then be used as a grammar for translations and transformations. Just
like in the case of synchronous PCFGs, we can simply parse new sentences using
the source `side' of the grammar, and derive the corresponding target side
immediately.

Formally, in \citet{poutsma2000coling}, linked subtree pairs are defined as follows:

\begin{definition}
Given a pair of linked trees $\langle T_1, T_2 \rangle$, a \emph{linked subtree
pair} consists of two connected and linked subgraphs $\langle t_1, t_2 \rangle$
such that:

\begin{enumerate}
\item for every pair of linked nodes in $\langle t_1, t_2 \rangle$, it holds that
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item both nodes in $\langle t_1, t_2 \rangle$ have either zero
		daughter nodes, or
	\item both nodes have all the daughter nodes of the corresponding node
		in $\langle T_1, T_2 \rangle$
	\end{enumerate}
\item every non-linked node in either $t_1$ (or $t_2$) has all the daughter
	nodes of the corresponding node in $T_1$ (or $T_2$), and
\item both $t_1$ and $t_2$ consist of more than one node.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Then, the \emph{bag of linked subtree pairs} is defined as follows: given a
corpus of linked trees $C$, the \emph{bag of linked subtree pairs} of $C$ is
the bag in which linked subtree pairs occur exactly as often as they can be
identified in $C$.

An important contrast with the earlier synchronous grammars for PCFGs, is that
in the framework of \citet{poutsma2000coling}, we are not necessarily dependent
on strong similarities between the tree structures on both sides (although,
ultimatlely, a strong similarity may still be a prerequisite for good
performance). This would make translations and transformations, such as in the
examples given in section \ref{subsec:synch}, possible.

Of course, it should be noted that, in this framework, it is unlikely that
\emph{all} subtrees on the source side are linked to subtrees on the target
side: especially in the (far from unlikely) case where the total number of
subtree differs, this has to be trivially false.

A problem with the DOT model, as described in \citet{poutsma2000coling},
consists of the fact that the complexity of parsing new sentences can be quite
huge, as the number of subtrees can be (at worst) exponential in the number of
nodes. For standard DOP-based parsing the Goodman reduction, which will be
described in the next section, has been found to resolve such issues: however,
because we do not have a complete set of subtrees available to use, it is
impossible to use this reduction right away. This question of finding a
suitable reduction for the DOT model as described in \citet{poutsma2000msc,
poutsma2000coling}, will be addressed at a later stage in this report.

\subsection{Goodman reduction}

A significant problem with DOP parsing, is the fact that the number of subtrees
that have to be included is exponential in the size of the tree. In
\citet{goodman2003efficient}, a solution to this problem is presented, that is
able to yield equivalent parse probabilities (but not equivalent derivation
probabilities) to regular DOP parsing, while limiting the number of rules to a
number that is linear in the number of tree nodes.

Here, the subtrees are replaced by a set of PCFG-rules, where nodes can be
either `addressed' or `non-addressed': in every tree, every node has a unique
address, and the addressed nodes only match with that specific address, whereas
the non-addressed nodes match with any node of the type.

It is proven in \citet{goodman2003efficient} that the PCFG resulting from the
Goodman reduction leads to equivalent parse probabilities as the underlying
STSG:

\begin{theorem}
This construction [the Goodman-reduction] produces PCFG trees homomorphic to
the STSG trees with equal probability.
\end{theorem}

\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

\subsection{Definition of DOP model}

We will assume a parallel corpus of pairs of trees with declarative and
interrogative versions of sentences. This assumption lies on the extreme
end of supervised parsing; other options are a bag of unrelated sentences
marked as declarative or interrogative in their root node. Whether the
assumption of a parallel corpus is cognitively plausible in terms of
language acquisition is irrelevant because the point is to learn
transformations from exemplars alone, without relying on built in primitives
for movement and insertions, or on a common, abstract representation for
sentences such as Deep Structures or Logical Form in generative grammar.

Assuming ordered pairs of trees, $\langle T_{\mathit{s}},
T_{\mathit{t}} \rangle $, may be enough to learn transformations
from data alone. Naturally the word forms will often coincide, so words are
implicitly linked (although this may be problematic with multiple occurrences
in the same sentence). Further annotation could add indices for each
constituent, but this implies labor-intensive annotation. More difficult than
the linking problem is the problem of structure mismatch. Consider the following
example:

\ex. \label{maryhappy}

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\begin{parsetree}
   ( .S.
    (.NP. (.NN. `Mary'))
    (.VP. (.VBZ. `is')
      (.ADJP. (.JJ. `happy'))))
\end{parsetree}
& $\iff$ &
\begin{parsetree}
  (.SQ. 
    (.VBZ. `is')
    (.NP. (.NN. `Mary'))
    (.ADJP. (.JJ. `happy')))
\end{parsetree}
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1em}

In the phrase-structure annotation of the interrogative of \ref{maryhappy} (as produced
by the Stanford parser), the \textsc{VP} constituent has arguably become a
discontinuous constituent \citep{harman1963generative}, but due to a strong,
pragmatically motivated preference for orthodox phrase-structures in
computational linguistics (as well as a completely indefensible Anglocentrism),
such information is sacrificed by collapsing the phrase-structure. This means
that the phrase-structure no longer encodes the connection of the verb and its
direct object. A more elaborate representation such as employed in the
discontinuous constituent phrase-structure grammar of
\citet{harman1963generative} would make it possible to streamline the
annotation of sentences so that less configurational information can be
preserved.  Note that discontinuous constituents are only a minor step in the
spectrum of constituency versus dependency. While a discontinuous constituent
violates the canonical definition of a tree, it is still word order which
determines constituency (e.g., in the example a fronted auxiliary verb
signifies VSO order), and it is not obvious that a free word-order language
could be profitably described by such a representation.  When \ref{maryhappy}
is represented using discontinuous constituents, the tree could look like this:

\ex. \label{marydiscont}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{maryishappy-crop.pdf}
\end{center}
\vspace{1em}

It is clear that this kind of representation provides a way to avoid structure
mismatch as a result of movement completely (ie., the bag of non-terminals will
be equivalent for both structures). The absence of the auxiliary `did' in the
declarative such as in \ref{marylike} can be represented by trace elements; an
even simpler strategy would be to allow structure mismatch as long as one of
the trees is a proper subtree of the other. The reason that it may be
worthwhile to avoid structure mismatch is that it maximizes the number of
parallel subtrees, which minimizes the violation of the DOP hypothesis stating
that all fragments should count in order to fully exploit the data at hand. It
may turn out that without isomorphic phrase-structures, the generalizing power
of synchronous DOP is not sufficient to handle complex, novel sentences (long
constituents, relative or embedded clauses, etc.).

The same definition for subtrees and fragments can be applied to discontinuous
structures, it is basically a matter of annotation and implementation to employ
them, not formalism.  Whether it will be necessary or worthwhile to adopt
discontinuous constituents will have to be determined emprically. Initially we
will attempt to use the standard PTB phrase-structure annotation and see how well
it works; this has the obvious advantage of the availability of large corpora such
as the WSJ, which can complement a small, hand-annotated parallel treebank.

\newpage %fixme

As a compromise between the impoverished PTB annotation and the rich but non-standard
discontinuous annotation, we could consider labelling POS tags with (former) parent
annotations, e.g.:

\ex. \label{maryhappyann}

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\begin{parsetree}
( .S.
    (.NP. (.NNP. `Mary'))
    (.VP. (.VBZ. `is')
      (.ADJP. (.JJ. `happy')))
)
\end{parsetree}
& $\iff$ &
\begin{parsetree}
  (.SQ.
    (.VBZ[VP]. `is')
    (.NP. 
	(.NNP. `Mary') )
    (.AP[VP]. (.JJ. `happy') )
    )
\end{parsetree}
\end{tabular}
\vspace{1em}

As operations we will restrict ourselves to the standard substitution operation. While
it may seem obvious to extend the DOP framework with movement and adjunction operations,
that has the downside of having to adapt the existing, well-defined formalisms,
including their probability models. On top of that we set out to induce transformations
from data alone, so making such things part of the formalism means smuggling in
{\em a priori} expectations (albeit only in a very general sense).

As estimation method we will employ the standard DOP1 estimator, but DOP*
\citep{zollmann2005consistent} or backoff-DOP \citep{sima2003backoff, prescher2004statistical} can be considered as well. Although sparsity of
evidence is claimed to be an insurmountable problem for non-nativist theories
by generativists (cf.\ \citet{macwhinney2004multiple} for a discussion), for
example the transformation of aux-fronting seems simple enough given elaborate
information such as phrase structures; e.g. \citet{bod2007linguistic} shows
that auxiliary fronting is learnable from positive evidence from Childes data
annotated with dependency structures.  For this reason it would seem that DOP1
should be adequate.

\subsection{A reduction for synchronous DOP}

As an instantiation of the previously mentioned assumptions, we will apply
Data-Oriented Translation to transformations. For implementation efficiency
we would like to use the Goodman reduction.

We are now faced with the situation, that we cannot simply apply the Goodman
reduction, reducing subtree pairs to PCFG rules, because of the reason that not
every subtree will always be a part of a subtree pair. In particular, the
PCFG-rules themselves, the `building blocks' of the Goodman reduction, may not
be a part of a subtree pair. This leads us to wonder whether it is possible to,
in some way or another, still perform a Goodman-like reduction on the bag of
linked subtree pairs.

It turns out that, indeed, a reduction is possible over the bag of linked
subtree pairs. For this, consider the notion of a \emph{minimal linked subtree
pair}:

\begin{definition}
For a pair of linked trees $\langle T_1, T_2 \rangle$, a \emph{minimal linked
subtree pair} is a linked subtree pair $\langle t_1, t_2 \rangle$, s.t. $t_1
\subseteq T_1$, $t_2 \subseteq T_2$, such that there is no other linked pair
$\langle s_1, s_2 \rangle$ where $s_1 \subsetneq t_1$ and $s_2 \subsetneq t_2$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
Every pair of linked trees can be reconstructed from the minimal linked subtree
pairs derived from it.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

Assume (towards a contradiction) that there is a pair of linked trees $\langle T_1, T_2 \rangle$ for
which this is not possible, given a certain bag of linked subtree pairs. Then
there has to be some linked pair of subtrees $\langle t_1, t_2 \rangle$ for
which:

\begin{enumerate}
\item It is not possible to construct $\langle t_1, t_2 \rangle$ from minimal
	linked subtree pairs.
\item All pairs of subtrees $\langle s_1, s_2 \rangle \subsetneq \langle t_1,
	t_2 \rangle$ can be constructed from minimal subtree linked pairs.
\end{enumerate}

It is impossible that this pair of subtrees is itself minimal: if it were, it
could trivially be constructed from linked minimal subtree pairs. So, for this
case to hold, the linked subtree pair $\langle t_1, t_2 \rangle$ must have a
proper linked subtree pair $\langle s_1, s_2 \rangle$. When `removing' $\langle
s_1, s_2 \rangle$ from the linked subtree pairs, we are left with a set of linked
subtree pairs (zero or one corresponding to the root nodes of $\langle s_1, s_2
\rangle$, and zero or one corresponding to each frontier node of $\langle s_1, s_2
\rangle$), from which the linked subtree pair $\langle t_1, t_2 \rangle$ can be
reconstructed.

So we are now, at least, able to construct the subtree pair $\langle t_1, t_2
\rangle$ from smaller linked subtree pairs. By assumption, all subtrees of
$\langle t_1, t_2 \rangle$ can be constructed from minimal subtree pairs. However,
this implies that $\langle t_1, t_2 \rangle$ can also be constructed from minimal
subtree pairs -- providing the contradiction to the assumption, and thus completing
the proof.
\end{proof}

In other words: just like the PCFG rules can be used as the `building blocks'
for the Goodman reduction, the minimal linked subtree pairs as defined above
can be used as the `building blocks' for a similar reduction. It should be
noted that, for all means and purposes, such minimal subtrees can be worked
with, as if they were simple CFG-rules, that just happen to have an additional
internal structure (which is ignored by the parser).

Like in the Goodman-reduction, we replace every elementary tree (i.e. every
minimal linked subtree pair) with $2^{(k+1)}$ annotated minimal linked subtree pairs,
where $k$ is the
number of nonterminals occurring as frontier nodes (which has to be equal on the
left and right hand sides). For the root node, and for every nonterminal node,
either an `addressed' version or a `non-addressed' version can occur.

The probability of a minimal linked subtree pair, with a root node (either addressed
or non-addressed) $R$, and addressed frontier nodes $X_1, \ldots X_n$, will be
\begin{displaymath}
\frac{n(X_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot n(X_n)}{n(R)}
\end{displaymath}
where $n(K)$ is the number of linked subtree pairs headed by the node $K$.

\subsection{(Joint) parse and derivation probabilities}

An important difference, between the Data Oriented Translation/Transformation framework, and ordinary DOP, is that a `derivation' does not just consist of the building blocks of a single tree, but rather of the combined building blocks of a pair of trees. It is, furthermore, possible that a left-side tree may be the most occuring tree in the set of derivations, but not be the left-side of the most probable joint parse. Take for example the following (abstract) situation:

\ex. \label{abstractexample}

\begin{tabular}{llllll}
\multicolumn{3}{c}{Tree-pair $\mathcal{A}$: Weight 2} &
\multicolumn{3}{c}{Tree-pair $\mathcal{B}$: Weight 2} \\
\begin{parsetree}
( .A.
    (.B. (.C. `x'))
    (.D. (.E. `y'))
)
\end{parsetree}
& $\iff$ &
\begin{parsetree}
( .A.
    (.B. (.C. `x'))
    (.D. (.E. `z'))
)
\end{parsetree}
&
\begin{parsetree}
( .A.
    (.B. (.C. `x'))
    (.D. (.E. `y'))
)
\end{parsetree}
& $\iff$ &
\begin{parsetree}
( .A.
    (.B. `x')
    (.D. (.E. `z'))
)
\end{parsetree} \\
& & \\
\multicolumn{3}{c}{Tree-pair $\mathcal{C}$: Weight 3} & \\
\begin{parsetree}
( .A.
    (.B. `x')
    (.D. `y')
)
\end{parsetree}
& $\iff$ &
\begin{parsetree}
( .A.
    (.B. `w')
    (.D. `z')
)
\end{parsetree}

\end{tabular}
\vspace{1em}

Here the left side of tree-pairs $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is, by itself, the
most probable left-hand side parse, but the tree pair $\mathcal{C}$ here is the
most probable joint parse.

So, instead of simply looking at the most probable parses and derivations (as we would do in the case of ordinary DOP, with or without Goodman reduction), we can now look at the most probable \emph{joint} derivations and parses. Whether we are, ultimately, most interested in the most probable joint parses, the most probable left hand side parses, or the most probable right hand side parses, can be subject to discussion. It may be argued that, ultimately, we are most interested in the most probable parse on the target side -- or perhaps even in the most probable \emph{sentence} on the target side.

\begin{theorem}
A `Goodman-like' reduction based on minimal linked subtree pairs leads to
equivalent joint parse probabilities (but not equivalent joint derivation
probabilities) as those of the original synchronous DOP (DOT) model.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof of this theorem is exactly analagous to those of Theorem 1 and 2 in \citet{goodman2003efficient}, with the exception that Theorem 1 has to be generalized for
situations with $n$ frontier nodes, rather than the $2$ from Goodman's paper.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
The `Goodman-like' reduction leads to the same left hand side and right hand side parse probabilities as those of the original synchronous DOP model.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
The probability of a left (or right) hand side parse is simply the sum of all joint parse
probabilities with that left (or right) hand side. Because the joint parse probabilities are invariant, so are the left (and right) hand side parse probabilities.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
The `Goodman-like' reduction leads to the same target side sentence probabilities as those of the original synchronous DOP model.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
This follows from the fact that the sentence probability of a sentence $s$ is simply the sum of all joint parse probabilities of tree pairs which, on the target side, yield $s$.
\end{proof}

\section{Implementation}

Because of complexity issues, we have decided not to compute the most probable joint parses of sentences, but simply compute the most probable joint derivation.
